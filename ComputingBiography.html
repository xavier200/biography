    <h1> Computing Biography</h1>
<p> <span style="color:red"> I actually have not had much background in web development.
  The main thing thing that got me to take a web development class was making
   my own computer. Another thing that got me into web development is that I
   was originally going to be a civil engineer. Unfortunatly I was barely able to
 scrape by in the second level of calculus so I decided to change my major to
 computer science which hopefully has more computers and programs than math.</span></p>
